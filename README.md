# socialmediaautomatelogin
Python code using selenium to interact with the browser to automatically login into various social media accounts like FACEBOOK , TWITTER, INSTAGRAM AND LINKEDIN . Takes a user input of which social media platfrm do you want to  login to . 
Whichever browser you use make sure you install it's driver like I installed Chrome Driver and pass the path to the driver variable in the code as a rawstring.Also you should have python3.xx installed to make this work on your own device. That is all you need to change to make this code to  work on your computer.
